CI/CD provides superior reliability by executing the pipeline in a clean, consistent, and automated environment for every change. This eliminates "it works on my machine" issues and ensures that every code push is validated, catching errors early and maintaining a reproducible and production-ready workflow that local, manual runs cannot guarantee.
